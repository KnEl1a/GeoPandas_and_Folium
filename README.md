# GeoPandas and Folium

This repository showcases examples and projects utilizing **GeoPandas** and **Folium** for geospatial data manipulation and visualization. The following notebooks are included:

- **`coordinate-reference-systems.ipynb`**: This notebook explores various coordinate reference systems (CRS) and demonstrates how to handle and convert between different CRS using GeoPandas.
- **`manipulating-geospatial-data.ipynb`**: This notebook covers fundamental techniques for manipulating geospatial data with GeoPandas, including data cleaning, merging, and spatial operations.

**GeoPandas** simplifies geospatial data manipulation in Python, while **Folium** enables the creation of interactive and visually appealing maps. These notebooks provide practical examples and code snippets to help you integrate these tools effectively in your geospatial projects.
